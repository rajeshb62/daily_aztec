 You're a very very very. It feels the level. It feels today. It feels a product in the book. It feels like we're used to continue. But we're used to be the peace life. I read the past out via the command line, as it's the other wallet. All of the different methods and uses possible, using for the aspect. Looting contract from the Asteric Starter repo. It was useful. You're an authwithit right out. There was some... You know. Confusion about how the... How the... Authwith got created with some confusion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some more quick consideration. Yeah. I've only started by the Jesuit of the world. I'm a high doctor. I'm a... I might be a musician in the new question. I'm a student. I'm a top in the world. I'm a student. I'm a student. Here I'm a student. Yeah. So we are looking at... At... At the voting contract and how used it and I'll be sure to be the author. That I high right at. And I picked up. It was that... Not the issue, but I could not figure out and publish it. If the authwith vote was getting used by the delicate... Who had their own vote, also, Spang. And I could only vote one for it. But I could not figure out. And firstly, for that issue, I've been able to read. Why is one there? One, second is the vote of the... The vote... The vote delegated to them. But... That... So I... And additionally, I could not figure out. The vote that got cast was it... The delegated vote was it their own vote. There is one way to test it. That... Be let's say the... The delegated party to get who I've picked... The vote delegated to them. That is who... Adds the authwith. Then the one who creates it. Be who adds the authwith. Is able to... Is first cast in the... The own vote. Before off it. And then the... Add you authwith. And then cast a second vote. I see backwards. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. As a good one from the contracts, so I won't be testing that. I compiled a second contract. I used the... A stick wallet... Address. I used the second contract. Okay. Yeah, I... I compiled... So I started going through all of the new work projects. In the... Asstick packages... Uh... directory. And I was able to compile a second smart contract. Uh... second... asstick and a smart contract. Which is one of the crowd's funding. So... which is great. So every... Contra... Unable to... I stick now to compile. And that I'm able to compile. Uh... and then I will be deployed. Because once I've come to... I feel... With the... I'm sure combined with World Time, which is applied. So... To be... A stick sandbox. So I've divided... And... Uh... Hopefully I will get to continue interacting with it. Uh... the crowd funding. And... ...out funding... ...acquire as the... ... degli... ...that is... ...wide-appointed... ...with expected... ...with... ...with expected... ...with... ...overcontra... ...with... ...and... ...second... ...second... ...second... The address of the user or the admin. So the current funding, some of the address to which we funding has to can be opened. So it's an aspect address. And third is some use 64. So it's a large integer, which is basically the timeline. It is the timeline, converting it to some new. So it should ask you to ask, how do you represent a day or one hour. So 12.0 for an hour. And that you 64.0 represents. Then there's a shared approach with the cloud. So I need to figure out because the target means that that's the only thing and then after that I can actually deploy it. And then I will be going to interact with it. So that's the second spot for that. This was five hours of charged, of charged, of a repo. Well, I can go to the Pramber Capitalist. Five hours of charged. And then I recorded the conversation five or six. And then beyond that, there was a bit of a bit of a tinkering. So I put that in a half an hour. Everything that's one record. I'll put that as a half an hour. So should I have lunch first? The food, the crab place. And then come back and work on this. I think that's a better idea. I like to do that. Let's go. Now, so yesterday was a good day. And the workflow is workflow. When I look at all the modifications, I've on for this. I stick clubs and projects. And good morning. I did full book. Every single day, there's so much happening week to week. It seems that there's something else that has happened, which is a man's new project that today is part of. Which is a competitor to SP1, which is a competitor to RISERO. They have results very fast. Much faster than both RISERO and RISERO. And RISERO and SP1. And I want I haven't even checked out any of my own check-out. SP1, I don't think that's all. And that's pretty much full book. But I want to obviously thank you for the visit. With the asset, it's as good as I am. It's a pretty good treatment for their court. The faster I'll scale up the asset, the better it gets for me. And I want to move out anything that is not critical. Out of my time line and spend more effort on the project. Which is under the command line in the court, in the case. In the beginning, which time. Let's go. I am given a hand. Wow, last one here. If these sets was so wide-blastier at this time. And I could have scaled up. But the biggest time is to tie it. I have not really completely missed in my time. But I've used the hand-pushing of one person to tie it. And the amount of the amount of money. And I've just done the margin. To do the partner-seedless things. And I understand why. I understand why. I'm not like because I've already used to come in the regular. Ever in the career before. After the engineering, which is after because I'm full, let's correct. No four. I understand why it's happening. So let's go. Let's go. Alright, let's have lunch. And then we come back. I stopped starting late today. We're fighting in the afternoon. The money session is gone.
