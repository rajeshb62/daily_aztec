 You are the starting of the speech. We start the audio only now. I've said we are coming back to the crowd funding, contract deployment on Aztec as a part of Compilation to GitHub with the artifact. And now I'm looking at an examing deployment contract. Now I'm looking to interact with the contract. I'm finding contract and I do that. I'm storing a new chat on Aztec. So I'm dumping the contract code. Oh, this is... This is Vigame. Yeah, so I have the outcome. So I have the outcome. So let's look at some of these lines. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. It's a one-pointing line contract code. I'm going to put it elsewhere. I'm going to put it in my clone. I'm going to put it in my clone. I'm going to tell you, called file. I'll do it. I interact with this contract. I'm using Aztec for a bit. And I see a live come on. So that's what I'm asking. Clond. I don't know if Claude has a contract in... Let me just paste. For the purpose to be exact, I think. Which just paste my CLL wallet. So, let's see a little bit. So what I'm going to do is explain the commands. I'm getting cursor to explain available to interact with the using Aztec wallet commands. And be elaborate if you can. So, I'm going to do this. I'm going to cursor is going to jump in. All the commands. I'm going to show you. Which is then I need to be clonded to that clondizer. Good set off. Good set off for. Good set off information. So, I'm going to show you the command. For the crowd to... For interacting with the crowd. And then we'll look at what the metal is. So first I'm going to copy paste. The entire... This one. The command available. As per an AI that has access to Aztec CLL like repo. Tell me more about your repo. Aztec CLL. Okay. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I am here. At that time, she created something like this and the face of herpiric dream. She creates her dream of a loving zmianless dream. What do you want? What do you want? Yan, where's Yan? Yeah. Where is Yan? Where's Yan? She's going to go in. Yeah, she's going to go in. And... Pull it. Alright, so I go back to Cloud and look at what Cloud has for me. So I have a question. All the time. There's a tad everything that I want, huh? Set up a Cloud and look at what I do. I can't say the response is... ...I can't say the response is... ...this is a contract code and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...and the way they say the command is... ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the way they say the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the command is... ...still in front of the track. ...and the command is... ...mastion to be moved before the track. ...and all элемers have been demolished in the entry limit. ...rem walking before that. ...so that's what it is. you have to use the number. So you basically can approve one sending. First I need to import both of them. And then into the send and to some addresses. Should I assign them private here? Can I can check the components? So I don't send to all. Let me do it to two users. The attack. And the attack. Just to change the neutral account. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then I need to import the data. And then to import the data. I need to import the data. And then click the left folder so that the data activates. In his dream. And you pray, Love and Lives Na'a. is used in the literature. You get the book, it is washing. So, I asked for a book, and I'm not buying it. And from the desktop, I'm running the trade on the... Oh, so on my buying, it's not running the latest model. It doesn't say 3.5.5.5.5. It's an older 3.5.5. And it's the same on my desktop. Okay, so, the color of the concise mode. I'm going to give short analysis. Get users, cryptography in several key surveys. Content-integrative verification through Shah-1, Shah-Dukh, Shah-Dukh, Shah-Dukh. Yeah? Every object can get, come at street, blocks, because you need hash, this is a description, but it is very cash-concestible. Yeah, I mean, it's relevant to the question that I asked. It's relevant for me. So, Claude gave me the right answer. Even if the question was a little... You correct? Then, the way? Good. The relevance is called, so, relevance. Secure new stortions of get our transitioning to Shah-2-Hoodies for stronger security. I see. Secure transport. When pushing, pulling over HDDPS, get users TLS encryption. Hmm. When using accesses for new operations, get the ability to accesses in pitch-in, and accesses each. It's not as simple as this. So, it is a little bit of a problem. For the more compression. Yeah, okay. Come at the side. Developers can perfectly sign, and you can always check and confirm that they are the very common. This proves the authenticity of whom they did commit. Particularly important in our first studies. Authentication, STDPS, and all kinds of things, are authentication using credentials. SSH key-based authenticate for remote operations. Would you like me to tell them, any of these aspects? STDPS authentication. I need to understand what later not now, and not STDPS authentication. These are international security sites like this. And, SSH key-based authentication for remote operations. Okay, so, we'll try to, I think that everything is best fixed now. Cool, cool, cool, cool, glad to know. I just love the cryptography. I earlier, okay, I only checked. I'm sure the cryptography used in payments. That was interesting as well. That's good to study because I want to look at payments. I don't understand anything. I like something I want to share. I want to share one of these channels. I understand anything. I don't know. I'll leave you, though. I just couldn't show, but I see who's here. What, in days and days? There are more things here, many of us are changed. So, that is a question, but there was something else that I just thought of not to talk to the exact activity right now. Oh yes, which is about ZK email, I found that ZK email public repository is in, it has a repository of all the public is someplace in the repo, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, of, of, of ZK email and which I need access to, I want to see all the protocols, all the service providers whose emails can be, uh, cooked and verified using ZK email, like that. So, that is an activity, and it's very, that reminds me. All of this learning is cool enough. What I need is to implement the, as text mark contract, for the ZK email account, good lot, good to be large, good to be large, good to be large, that is something that is my whole, and I'm going to go back to the street. Okay, so here I'm looking at back to the crowdfunding contract, day two, yesterday was private button contract, day two, and it's boring, we crowdfunding contract. Uh, minute 22 of, uh, looking at today's data. Based on the contract code and available seal like a match, here's how to interact with this crowdfunding contract, first, deploy the contract, ask the collective by crowdfunding on this song, yeah, I've deployed it, to donate tokens, ask the collect send up to, yeah, first, to approve it, to come, then send donate, what do I want to do, what do I want to do, send this, uh, basically the transaction, uh, to interact with any method of the contract, approve is a matcha-dom contract, uh, donate, the matcha-dom contract, withdrawing, doesn't matter, I'm going to contract, so there are only three methods. So I'll prove it, open, all set amount, yeah, and I'm on, sorry, 18 decimal, huh, so it's like way, so if you want to say 10 tokens, then you put 10 followed by 18 zeros, all right, fuck up me, so all right, let's say the backend, attached both have, I mean, tokens first, I give them, public access, huh, book public tokens, so they have their own tokens, so they'll make a thousand of them, and each of them, 10, 10, huh, so they'll make it 10, 10,000, and then they can send us minutes to one, huh, I can examine this, uh, I'm just gonna send that, right, so the commands for, uh, meeting and sending the transactions are in the, uh, getting started, section of the extended docs, and go there, my application for annual permit, and then the, uh, in my town, is, uh, still in passes and by third half of the sales, stage after 15, what's the one centaneous, fuck me, I'm super, fucking nervous, until you know, get sent to the, uh, I hope that in the top, you. Let me ask you, ا� go ahead, I'm sorry, o sea, I don't know, this is the story. Anyway. I go back to my mind. I go back to my mind. My dog's, I stick dogs. Dog's, I stick network. I go to the command where I still need to. I go back to my friend's. I go back to my friend's. I go back to my friend's. I go back to my friend's. I go back to my friend's. I go back to my friend's.
