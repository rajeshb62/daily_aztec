Let's go. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go Yeah, this is what Claude explains to me is happening by going on track. So, the private voting cast vote. So, that's one, five voting ads, delegating, and then we can, so that is create, or create a create for a fit, be users or get for fits, so that's the second, second command. So, it's good, good use case for a fit, all right. And the second one, the second function there is, on B, B users or with, you know, cast, then gets cast votes on half a fit and the authorization is limited by the method which is cast vote, by the party which is new, you can use and it's limited by the candidate, you know, it's going to be limited to the candidate vote, in a sense, because we move the candidate, and this even can be a little higher. But, that I got off there, but not quite far, we are going to get right. The second most simpler use of authboard is end vote and vote. So, there's one admin, one, depending on the vote and after that, more votes can be cast or the votes cast will be counted. So, we saw yesterday that the block in which the, a partner gets deployed, that block, starts the vote and the end vote this, this, this, this call, which is end vote and it's a public function and only admin calls. So, it's a simpler, a computer, so it just checks if the method is centered, is the owner of the admin, is the admin basically, there's some admin available, all right. So, let's go. So, we have that, we basically see authorization words, okay. So, there's an order, add authboard, so we'll clear authboard, which it creates on behalf of for B, there's an add authboard, I suppose all this. The front B can actually, is working secrets, so it can access, it can access, it can access the loss, it can generate values nullifiers, it can execute, or there's a content. So, admin function and what creates on-chain to codapotization, no kicker, secrets in words in terms of information, you have to get it, the second degree consideration, private authorization, each authboard is specific to the exact function, the specific candidate, the authorized account, cannot be used for different candidates, still maintains what privacy, through nullifiers, one time use, you know, nullifier mechanism, yeah, well, it's something, it's not school, can be removed, admin definition can be removed by admin, multiple back-as-positive, multiple main-time-advertisement, private authorization, no cryptographic secrets in words, key differences, yeah, I expect security, private cash code and public endbook, so, the cryptography, the book book book, permission check, yeah, check it out, yes, yes, so we say, for these three different stories, there's an story in the private castle, the origin of the origin, the main word is on-chain required, story of chain weakness, which is the weakness, which is in the pxc of the user, which is user-ray, there's an option, pxc is option, this is ability, one time use, multiple, what is over, we have to fix this, so there is a project, no, there is, that design, you do when this becomes part of the pxc and then it leaks, secrets, from pxc to the hacker, is it possible, we have to attack what, story of chain weakness on chain-taker, yeah there's a difference, reusability, one time use for private cash code, public endbook, multiple is then the user can end word multiple times, reusability, no time use multiple, set up, two step process, one step process, the vocation, self-provoking, why, and only five, admin can be book, how many users back then, delegate routing, admin back up, how many users back then, delegate routing, how many users back then, delegate routing, has to wallet, or I lost it, delegate routing, common user's patterns, step one, motor gate witness, step two, delegate exit, step three, delegate password, send, password, tables, add, admin back up, let's check whether it's a transaction, and the word back up from admin, okay, okay, this is a punch I'm throwing, and it, good minutes, yeah, the word, the word, the contract last, that's what we call, okay, let's check, let's check, and then people This is a very beautiful one. Come on, open it. I think that's something else steps. How it goes. That's why this is a pleasure. So you will adapt up for... ...to... ...a... ...three-seven-chamber-comers. We can back up our way to end-world fun. No cryptographic secrets and body. Come on in. And take a look. Well, the considerations of what is the story in that? What is the meaning of the meaning of all of it? Easy-pile-bought-on-bought-on-contract-contract-ext. The story is stuck to the story from the multiple. Which is admin address to it. So the admin address is stored. The send-word is stored in a memory. Context is the send-a-roll. The admin can end-world storage, wood, and it, by the through. So storage has all these variables which are relevant. Adminic model. Stuck-stool. Admin optimization. Come on in. Next you will address action and work. Back up admin address. Contract address. Your contract address. From current admin address. Accumant. Come on in. Admin optimization. Come on in. Admin optimization. Come on in. Come on in. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Also, action through. It's a fabulous operation. The card. And what function being authorized. Back up admin address. Address. Back up admin. Your reply, working contract address. Must be current admin service. complete example of these steps. How it works. That's the quality. In this, that is mean. Let's make this lesser evaluation, to see this sound a bit faster than usual. And we are not talking about the address, right? So, the address action method and back of the address is the address. Contract address, the contract address from the letter name. It says like two address, among components. Authorization, the public authorization, the card, and word, the function of the authorization. Back up as many address address on the back of the letter name. The authorization of the letter name. The authorization of the letter name. The authorization of the letter name. The authorization of the letter name. You guys sleep 15 minutes of fun too. No? I can't. Permission? Check flow. I wish to run out earlier. See, they want to pack the bags of cakes. Hmm.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being a joke. See, a check software, which is a check software. There are two things called C. Isoplan. C comes back. Yes? Then, execute any, and then be, so, it gets you to do it. Then, see? No? No, don't. Please use it back up admin. Let's take one at send and word. One right at the center. Come back again.

So yeah, what's a pretty important invention for development of the CZK space. And the X says now, we have technically our proving system that we're going to add seconds called HONGT, which is hyper optimized HONGT. We've had many derivations of HONGT along the way. We had HONGT and we had turbo HONGT and we had ultra-HONGT. Now we're in the HONGT. I think we're using like mega-hawk for HSEC. But ZAC basically says it's not really, it doesn't look like punk anymore. It's been so many things tweaked about it. It changed a lot, but yeah, it's been a lot development of the CZK space over the past few years. It's just like a lot of brain power and a lot of investment in the potential of this technology. And obviously we're excited by building this completely new network. So yeah, going back to the phone papers, like the where it all started. But yeah, ZAC was just, they were trying to solve this problem. And as ZAC started as this company called the Credit Mints and they were trying to put corporate debt on a theory on something. And basically they realized, you can't, like businesses will not do this without substantial privacy. So ZAC went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out ways to do this. And yeah, pause to go to this side. So cool. Yeah, going deep on pump that. That's a cool thing. Well, I haven't done this all, but definitely a very important thing for you. Um, partnerships with accelerators or VC companies. We don't have any formal programs. It's very informal currently. We are, it's going to get easier to basically formalize this process as we get to test that. And like, we can basically validate products easier. I would say currently it's the informal sense. Like if you look at our investor list, like our main investor, they're like A16Z, I think it's on a website somewhere. I'm not sure if it's on Apple Watch. But our investors are definitely interested in investing in applications or like other infrastructure built on asset for sure. So we can definitely make intros if you're building something or you have ideas for something. We can help make those connections. So if you want to ping me on Discord or I'm Josh C on the asset discord, if you guys are all in there. But I can definitely connect you with folks that can, can set you can chat with for sure. We'll probably have more formal accelerator programs. Once we launch mainnet, before mainnet, we're very interested in basically testing, just testing the infrastructure layer. And also just aligning on standards across the ecosystem. And terms of like the wall, it's look like a, like a, what a toka standard, it could look like various contract standards. And yeah, once we get to mainnet, it's going to be a lot easier for us as well as for people actually like looking to raise money to do so. Like, yeah, the path dependency of having as technical exists will no longer be there because the network will be alive. So yeah, it's definitely hard to get the time to attention when we're still like pre-testnet. So just like, yeah. Yeah, so non-technically user is using asexervices. Yeah, I mean, this will be like using asex should be as easy as using as the area. Or actually using asex should be easier than using as the area. Ethereum has this dependency on private key management and in externally under counts, which asex does not have asex as native construction, which basically is like it's very, very abstract in the sense. Like basically we have these account contracts that all you need to do is the account contract goes to verify a proof and if the proof verifies then that account contract is authorized as a send-it transaction. So basically, if you can write into our program, whatever you can write into our program for that can generate a proof, you can basically use that to get access to an account contract. So in our example contract currently, our example account contracts, we do have like a ECDA, ECDSA, SINER account, or a SINER account. So like that's very familiar for folks that are already using blockings today, where you use EPDSA signatures to authorize transactions from accounts. So you can use private keys, but then in the account contract, the account contract is verifying that a signature provided matches a public key stored in the account contract storage. But you could have a account contract that just accepts a password. Like so you have to just provide proof of password to send a transaction over the account. You could protect a account contract through like an ECDA email, where you need to send an email from a specific email address in order to authorize a transaction from an account. Or like using proof of JWT's, or literally anything you can think of to generate a proof of, like someone looked at it. Oh, could I generate a use a ECDA machine learning algorithm that detects my voice of like me singing a specific song and it authorizes a transaction from an asset account contract. There might be some difficulty on the GKML piece, but like in theory, yes, that would work. Which is pretty cool. So the idea is we can have wallets that are something that's been that we've actually seen that's pretty great using pass keys, which have gotten really popular in the past year, in browsers, using pass keys to basically control account contracts. So like users are just providing biometric authentication or whatever on a specific web page, and that can authorize authorize things, which in my opinion is much better than the existing world of like, here in the account. So yeah, in short, yes, not tactical uses will be able to use as such, so once they're authorizing transactions, then it's also type of familiar, like swap token interface or send token interface or log in with specific asset account interface or whatever. So, the important question. And the way that we're thinking about this at the protocol level is like, it's similar to like a theorem development where like, for a long time, like, as text protocol is a tool for building kind of application. Just like a theorem is a tool for developers to build new kinds of applications. There will be software companies that build new products and services on the protocol and those products and services will attract users to the network. So, same with Aztec, like a lot of, I mean, we're starting to see real like user product applications that don't even talk about being a theorem or don't even talk about blockcains. Users just have a good user experience using them and it's enabled by the underlying technology that's the same idea with Aztec. Aztec's an unlock new capabilities for people and they won't necessarily care that they're using a privacy for their being blockchain under the hood. They're just saying, oh, I can do cool things using this application that I couldn't do before. And Aztec has helped me to possible. Yeah, so advanced tech is basically just abstracts away. Well, good advanced technology just abstracts away that complexity is pretty true. So, users just see new capabilities that don't see all of the crazy complexity under the hood in its own property. Because, yeah, if it's not abstracted away, people just don't use it. Like, I mean, how long has it taken for, you can just like, early Ethereum days, and I mean, it was four years after Ethereum lost before we even got D5, like three or four years before they compound and unislawed launch. And even then, it was pretty much only used by developers for several years. The only people using Ethereum were like technically savvy agents and developers. Like, yeah, are you will have much of penetrated mainstream ways? I think NFTs helped a lot for sure. Like, you're going to open C and doesn't feel super technical. Yeah, I think there's a lot of potential at this layer of basically the wallet layer. Just in terms of like building products, even not just for has that produced a blockchain to general, I feel like the wallet layer is still like one of the best places to be like building products. Because that's really user's gateway to the chain, and they're going to need to interface with that to do anything else. Like, you can just like, you look at meta-mask existing pre-years and years, just literally being in a transaction signer tool basically. And then they just like integrated a Dex aggregator, not even excellent rates or anything, and they just started like printing money in terms of money. It's like that convenience piece is like, it's not only convenience, but it's just like reducing complexity for users. Like, they can just do it in meta-mask and have to go in URLs, they trust it, it's been around for a long time, and there's already like millions and millions of meta-masks bought themselves. I think there's a lot more potential to build really cool user experiences using asset, and it's a kind of transaction piece. And there's actually a lot more that asset wallet has to do. I mean, earlier in the call, we talked about decrypting private state, relevant for a user, like that's something that no public blockchain has to do or have to deal with, so like that's a big piece of complexity already. But yeah, just around like also generating like a client-side proofs that could be some in wallets, like it's remains to be seen in the call that's actually developed. But yeah, being able to generate proofs for users is going to be really comfortable. Yeah, we have a few teams that are building wallets for asset currently. And they said they see what they come out with really, and we have test-set-set stuff. But I expect that's the potential to have a lot of opportunity here. We've got like six minutes left over top of the hour. Any other questions from folks? Any follow-ups? Yeah, I want to ask you just quickly about, is it for them to run the, do you know, do you know? Do you know the development of the security on the server for a test-set-set-set? Is it for them to still open? Let's think it's closed. Let me see. There's another one that popped up. Okay, here's the form. The problem is we put a form up and like it gets crushed by bots. It's like all these other protocols. Yeah, like air drop harmonies is really annoying. It's not that frustrating. I see us, you're there's one that announcements with a dog, a local dog's forum. Take a ticket switch. You mean the form? Yeah, you have a form there's one for the local dog's forum. Yeah, links out to a test network. I think Google forms spam protection is much better than whatever we were using on our website. That's probably why it won't sound. But it looks like on this forum you can indicate that you're a secret share of proof. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and put this in the video. I'll show you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. Yeah, nice. Agents, your question. Best channel on Discord. The most active. You could ask questions in general and I can just like read answer or there's like a developer question section. For dev chat. I think if you have more general questions about Aztecs, just put it in general. And we can chat. And then. Yeah, don't chat should be fine. We don't have a ton of channels. I'm pretty much looking at all of them so it's not hugely important. But yeah, there's not a ton of just like general chatter about the sort of thing. There's a few folks asking very specific questions that are like building stuff. Folks that are building block explorers in wallets and things like that. I'll just ask questions. Not already contracts. And then. Other than that, there's just like. People just. Jump jumping in general and saying hi. So yeah, we don't have a ton of action. Yeah, but definitely feel free to see some questions and certain conversations. Any other last many questions? All right. Hmm. Cool. Yeah, thanks everybody for coming. It definitely makes a lot more fun to chat about this stuff. Can you guys ask us some questions? So this runs every week at this time. So maybe we'll see you next week. Maybe we'll see in the future week. But yeah, I'll be here and see you guys around. Yeah. Well, it's called done with just entered as take a weekly call for a bit. And it was okay. It was okay. It was really boring. I mean, that's not to. That reminds me. These exercises have been on. Using the wallet on private voting contract. That's been. That's been boring. Really. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hmm. Three hours or two and a half of this working. Let's say, or off with, I did use off with. And then. And I'm kind of get what off with this. There's basically a bunch of notes and nullifiers. Giving permission to somebody else to look at your data, look at your. Or authorize them for you acting on your behalf. Then that was okay. I understand. Yes, they'll get calls to be basically create off with. And then you add off with and the other party adds off with. And then. Yeah. What on your behalf? That part I'm test. But we have. It was. Oh, kind of under the mirror. I mean. So that's a big part of. A past, a, uh, uh, what account that part did get answered. Okay. This is a. Hmm. Well, there's a token contract. But I don't feel like trying and obviously this is. You've got to think so anymore. But at some other time I might have a. I want to try. something else. I am still trying to figure out how to get the final vote vote. So that is not, yeah I voted ended. So there are minisators that were said during, I want to actually also count the vote. All right, let me see my list at the vote, I send it. But, that's not the vote. So it says the voting is ended. Not found in contract, they be I. Fufu, don't know if they are not found in contract, they be I. What they have. I say, I vote in the end, they write here, the voting is ended. You see, that's cool. Using the signed sandbox. Well, the local contract is on, which I can use for shielding and shielding, sending and shielding, sending and so on. So that's interesting. Of course, of course it is interesting. That is Fufu and then, okay, let's look at this mark contract and then look at the local contract. Well, you just want to smart account under the look at what you see, okay, what are the methods of account. That I can. That I can use here. From field must have any point method. So it's apparently, make sure you're using the account that was specified as admin during contract deployment. When the voting, how do I tell the votes cast for all candidates and get reserved? Oh fuck. There's a good vote, really. Let's go. Okay. Let's see, I'll call the end question function. So, okay. Let's see, I'll call the end question. Okay. Okay. After all the fuck me. It's okay, it's time to kind of explode this. Okay. Let's try and understand the voting contract after this. So, let's show it a little bit. We're going to be a big load. Explain to me. I'll strike contract. We want to try and be a stick wallet guy's methods. We want to try that. Maybe I should. Yeah, I should use that to show it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then you can use easy for voting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's macros functions and storage. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yay. But add telephobic. Yeah, I just go to that contract and this act of telephobic candidate, dotting you, you will context what the hell is that man? I mean, photocerter, yes, can I, which is, oh, should be a better public internal, add telephobic, so I'm going to talk about telephobic, so I'm going to talk about telephobic. So I do telephobic, see, fuck me, and I'm going to participate with a so much source K-P, I'm not a add to telephobic, so candidate field, assert, storage, water and retreat, and it goes false. So what is the, okay, I get the telepart, and then there's dotting q, mutable context of the telephobic, that very powerfully, it looks like but it's also very casual. My, my, my, my, my, yeah, I'll serve you later, serve you later, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll have to, I'll serve that, what has not ended, huh? Let, uh, new tally, full's, stories.tally, at the candidate, read it, plus one. Stories tally, at candidate, oh, plus one. Stories tally, at candidate, or try it, you tell me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, public end vote. So, there are these as tech variables called context, called storage, for all these macros, well, I'm good, I'm glad I did that stuff, because we're willing to know the concepts. From finite vote, otherwise, how only admin can end vote, storage ended, unconstant, get vote, candidate, fill up a fill, storage tally, at candidate, read, store, store, store, store, tally, at candidate, or read. Far through, simple. What is this whole tally-gifting? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember something like that, but just how much time I understood. And what they're doing on the stand is, I think, probably three hours, three hours, and a, I think, a big half in our, the shit starts, which is, which is, well, what it is, the shit.
