Deployed Aztec hardcoded schnorr account contract to sandbox using TS script. 

Discovered some modules in noir-projects in aztec-packages which have the necessary noir methods that can be used to create custom account contracts. including is_valid_impl, get_authwit*something* function and innerhash outerhash usage which I have seen used in custom schnorr account. These are the authwit folder and aztec folder in aztec-nr folder of noir-projects folder of aztec-packages. 
1. aztec-nr folder which contains ALL aztec related dependencies needed by aztec smart contracts: https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr
2. aztec- specific to accounts some methods need this folder in aztec-nr. it is most needed import in aztec smart contracts https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec
3. authwit- has entrypoint, is_valid_impl, get_authwit*something* functions, innerhash outerhash usage. https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/authwit
Above are strictly aztec smart contract dependencies (equivalent of solidity dependencies if you were building in EVM)
4. many noir project examples like token contract, crowdfunding contract, escrow contract, counter contract, etc are in noir-contracts folder in noir-projects folder of aztec-packages. https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/noir-projects/noir-contracts

You want typescript bindings in order to interact with sandbox from a webapp. (Can a smart contract deploy a smart contract/ account? yes... but need to think about how, but you anyway need to be able to deploy contract via webapp using TS). These bindings and stuff you need for webapp to access smart contract are in yarn-project folder of aztec-packages. 
aztec.js- most used such js package has objects like pxe, accountmanager that you need for smartcontract interaction https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec.js
cli-wallet- it is also in yarn project folder. using which i access sandbox and run aztec-wallet commands in terminal. https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/cli-wallet
aztec- there is aztec folder in yarn project folder of aztec packages. which is important when building webapp but I need to recollect from my aztec-wallet implementation why i need it https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec
accounts- contains ts bindings of schnorr account default out of the box created by devs, etc.  https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/accounts
circuit.js- contains zk related stuff we need in user apps like field elements, Fr, salt etc. https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/circuits.js
testing- get initialtestwallets method to get deployed walelts at the beginning of sandbox running.
